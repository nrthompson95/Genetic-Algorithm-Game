# Genetic-Algorithm-Game
A simple guessing game which uses a configurable number of "creatures" to guess a number.


## Instructions
Run in your simulator or on your iPhone. Use the "Advance Generation" button to advance and the "Reset" button to reset. Fitness is a measurement of how close the numbers are on a binary level.

## The Life Cycle
The life cycle is as follows:

1. Breed the creatures in pairs based on their fitness score (the highest two, then the next two, etc).
2. The new creatures created have their genome recombined.
3. All creatures up to the max number allowed survive, and the rest die.

## To Add:
In the future I intend on adding the following:

1. Configurable rates of recombination.
2. The ability for creatures to breed more than one time in a given cycle.
3. Hopefully more!
